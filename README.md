This workspace contains a minimal TypeScript script with a single exported function `greet`.

Files:
- `script.ts` - One function: `greet(name?: string): string`
- `run_script.js` - Small runner that imports compiled JS and prints the result.

To run locally (if you have Node + ts-node):

```powershell
npm install
npm run start
```
# random
